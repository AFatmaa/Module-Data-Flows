# How To Get Help

Learning to ask good questions is a key skill for a developer and you should practice this every week at CYF. You must spend a lot of time learning how to describe problems clearly and systematically:

Problem-solving is the real (marketable) skill of software developers. If you do not have questions to ask about your work, ask for some different work. Don't miss this opportunity to break down challenging problems with a large team of developers.
